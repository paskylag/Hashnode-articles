## JavaScript vs Python

Let be clear about one thing, before we go over ourselves on these two programming languages, both are pretty the most interesting programming language for beginners, but to further stretch an assumption on their mastery will be to commit straw-man fallacy; which means to misrepresent an assumption where as the real subject was not addressed. And to address the real subject is to thoroughly dismember the two programming language and characterize them on the basis of their optimization.


Python was a casual fun project created by Guido van Rossum, the project took some years to complete while JavaScript was only created within a span of ten days out of necessity by Brendan Eich while at Netscape. Although the duration of creation does not matter in the grand scheme of things, but it clear shows the level of urgency and the precision  they both employed to create these two very basic programming languages, and to some extent we can invariably assume that's more reason Python seem to be more easy to read and maintain compared to JavaScript, It will be interesting to take an introspective and academic view of both languages so as to understand their very nature.


Python is commonly used for backend engineering in web-development and backend  is commonly referred to as server-side of web development while JavaScript can be used for both frontend engineering which is commonly referred to as client-side of web development it can also be used for backend engineering. Python forms the foundational basis of the design in data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, astronomy while JavaScript is attributed to forming the foundational basis of the functionalities in web-development and android development due to it flexibility and adaptability.

To go through the syntax differences explicitly, will rather be a bit difficult task, hence, i have taken a few specific code differences in other to illustrate below:


 Lets start from the basics: Commenting
 
> > Python
# firm -single commenting

> > JavaScript
//-single commenting
/* */-multiple commenting

In python the code block is depicted by indentation while in JavaScript it is done using curly braces for example;
> > Python 
firm=6: print(firm)

> > JavaScript
var firm=6; {console.log(firm)}

Primitive Data types in python includes:        Primitive Data types in JavaScript includes:  

1. Integer(0,1,2,3,4,5)                                        1.Undefined                                  4.Number(1,2,3,4,5)
2.float(1.2345)                                                  2.Boolean(true, false)                  5.BigInt
3.Boolean(true, false)                                      3.String("firm", "saving")              6.Symbol

Input and Output in python:                            Input and Output in JavaScript:
firm_input=input(int("Enter a number":))        var firmInput=window.prompt("Enter a number": )
print(firm_input)                                                {console.log(firmInput)}

In terms of syntax mastery python seem to have an edge over JavaScript due to its non-complexity and readability, although in the area of preference of learning it is advisable to pick the one that logically fit any beginners area of specialty. For example those whose interest hinges on web development it is necessary to learn JavaScript as the preferred programming language while those who want to delve into backend engineering, data analysis, machine learning, and the likes are strongly advised to learn python as their preferred programming language. 


For the general beginners who are roaming the world of programming still looking for what pitch to perch, my advice is to start learning, because the biggest disease in programing is procrastination. Which ever one you eventually master, trust me, you will still be celebrated and be paid well regardless.
