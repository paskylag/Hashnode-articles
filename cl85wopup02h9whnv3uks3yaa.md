## The right time to start

To start this article one need to understand that life is not fair and going into it with a laisse-faire attitude will only complicate the overtly unfair life.

Taking this into account is to fully prepare that the journey into 'tech' is an endless bandwagon that sometimes lead to a bottomless pit, the power to continue can stay at equilibrium, yet, learning seems to move in jet-like dimension especially if you are locked-in to coding, it is even more demanding for those whose direction hinges on tech-writing, ours is a long stretch of  process which requires constant research and networking in other to gather data and direction from people's experience.

The reality opens different meaning to different people, we often exaggerate the difficulties faced in the art of learning to understand this complex industry, considering that a lot are still wallowing in the jaws of procrastination while some are gassing-out  for lost time, let me quickly bust your bubble(make believe fantasies); the tech industry is hard not very hard though, but know this and know peace. There is no gainsaying that fortunes favors the bold in this industry, the unspoken rule is: ''start something'' even if it is nonsense, which most time it is often the case.


There is no perfect timing to learn how the technology industry works, but, it is always wise to start when you have enough spare time to play with, because this art is the art of timing, it takes away your attention and vulnerabilities easily, so don't necessarily keep tab of the time so that you don't become pedestrian in the servicing of your urge, oftentimes, this leads to despondency and early fatigue, the best approach is to take it one day at a time.


For those who want to dive into development sector the website developers-frontend and Backend should focus their energy in learning the basics of programming using the usual programming languages like moving HTML,CSS, JavaScript, React, Nodejs and the likes. The real problem i have faced over time, is not the failure of starting, it is the failure of consistency because the journey requires constant building and for you to build anything worthwhile as a beginner  at least it takes a month or two on the average.


The reality is usually the same for most programmers when they are starting out, the fire will only burn for a while until it meet a challenging bug and all verve begin to quench, it takes the encouragement of communities, programming groups, fellow programmers and getting involve in project to resuscitates the quenched fire. It is very important to link up with people with the same problems and goals, no one is an island in the tech industry, we all need each other.


For those who want to start their journey, please start, and those who are locked-in procrastination remember: fortunes only favors the bold and for those of us whose fire is about to die, kindly join a community.
