## One year of nothingness(techie)

Life throws a lot of stuffs at us, like thorns and other times flowers, while the former can often be unbearable the later sometimes can be discouraging.
 
By mid-2021, i was deeply confused on the direction to take in life considering that i have graduated a few years back doing some odd jobs here and there, without making any definitive headway. Studying engineering in my home country Nigeria might be fun but the fun stops immediately you graduate from school, when real life struggles kicks-in.


I was at a friends place mid-2021 when a friend of mine who had just graduated from a tech academy in my home country was complaining about the complexities of programming, its demands and sophistication. He studied UI/UX which really hinges on graphics with little application of any programming language in his daily design works. This fascinated me, and i got challenged to delve into the world of programming full-time. After a month or two with peripheral trials, i got inducted to the realities of my friends dilemma, truly programming is no child's play.


The first six-month went by like an empty train travelling at no specified destination, learning html(Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) got me excited at first, believing that my journey into tech would be really straight-forward compared to my friend's lamentations until i met with JavaScript a programming language created just in 10-days by  Brendan Eich while working for Netscape. Sometimes i often wonder, why a programming language created in such a short period of time could be so complicated and yet so necessary in building websites and various technological applications. JavaScript had made me a learner for life, i keep learning new features new strategies new implementation methods, still on JavaScript until i joined a learning community and discovered that there are better and less complex languages which are also helpful for beginners like myself.


In the eleventh month, i have built projects which are really not projects per-say but just replicas of mini online adds-on works and i feel after acquiring a lot of information i have not been able to really bring it on as regards building something meaningful and attractive. My journey is rather complicated, because sometimes i had to take jobs along the way which sometimes distracted my attention, a year went by just understanding the fundamentals, within a year might be a long time for some people but its worth the patient, i have decided that the second year will be based on building, collaborating, connecting, and doing a lot of community participation.


Its scary to looking back the past year, it was filled with backlights and wild thunderstorms. JavaScript got me thinking, while python gave me a second look of things in the programming language space, and as a beginner all these feelings are real and expected, one only need to embrace them and understand that the world of technology is an endless expedition with limitless opportunities, it is more like our galaxies been programmed into our small gadgets.


Remember, the goal is not to get to a specific destination, the goal is to keep learning new things, improving capacity, understanding latest updates and getting hired for quality participations.
