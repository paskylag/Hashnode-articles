## The biggest lies in learning programming(tech)

One of the lies we are fed while learning programming will be: "Don't worry, its easy just keep building"  they forget to add easy can be frustrating sometime or often stories of the rush of money after mastering a particular programming language and the exaggeration of timing, some people are quick to exaggerate the exact period to gain mastery or some form of competence, all these are the snippets of lies told to beginners. 


The reality is quite slightly different depending on the personality, drive and ensuing environment. While learning programming can be fun, sometimes, it can also be a nightmare once you encounter bugs, challenges, errors as a matter of fact these are the times you will realize: moving into 'tech' was a mistake. You can be on a line of code for days trying to figure out the very meaning of the code, and this trend tend to go beyond patience, it requires constant mental exercise the stretching of the mind to create analytical concepts which can be identified and accepted by the computer.

The lies of getting easy money in technology need to be quickly dispelled so that every beginner can understand the bottlenecks, challenges and nightmares' in the field of programming, there is no easy money anywhere, to get a dime in tech trust me you would have spent countless hours coding and rehashing old tutorials because coding is similar to learning how to fly an airplane you need constant practice, reiterating the fact that no one has a monopoly of knowledge on any programming language, not even Bill Gate in his early days of programming.

Sorry, it might look i am shattering all your hopes and good intentions, that is not the purpose, i only intend to tell the truth wherever possible on this life changing journey. Considering, you are to have your own example of  people who scaled through or become successful within three months or six months of learning, kindly note: that they are the exceptional cases, it is not a statistics for the global average.



Learning to program is an unending journey, you have to keep learning even after gaining mastery because innovation is a phenomenon in the tech space. The handwork one has to put must be full gear especially in the beginning might be quite tasking, trying to cover an ample amount of space using various learning techniques along the way, although oftentimes, building projects is quite an acceptable technique in gaining mastery of programming, yet, it is also the most challenging.


After a lot of silent hours seated on an harmless chair and mindless table, sleepless nights, enormous amount of internet research and learning, unending collaborations, bugs detection and resolving, tears and frustrations: i mean literally and realistically, then the understanding will come, the fame and recognition will come like a silent knight with it shinning armor and most importantly the much anticipated money will ride-in.
